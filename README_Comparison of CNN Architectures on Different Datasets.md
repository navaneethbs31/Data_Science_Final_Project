##Comparison of CNN Architectures on Different Datasets

Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of different CNN architectures on various datasets. Specifically, we will evaluate LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, ResNet, Xception, and SENet on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. The comparison will be based on metrics such as loss curves, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


Approach
1. Load and preprocess the datasets (MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10).
2. Implement the following CNN architectures: LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, ResNet, Xception, and SENet.
3. Train each model on each dataset, recording the loss and accuracy metrics.
4. Evaluate the performance of each model on the test sets using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Plot the loss curves and other performance metrics for comparison.
6. Analyze the results to understand the impact of different architectures and datasets on model performance.


Results
The expected outcomes of this project include:
- Comparative loss curves for each model on each dataset
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model on each dataset
- Analysis of the results to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture on different datasets
